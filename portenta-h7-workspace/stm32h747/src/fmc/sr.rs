The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up to 16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI bus for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of the FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written to the memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait until the FIFO is empty.\n\nYou can [`read`](crate::generic::Reg::read) this register and get [`sr::R`](R).
